# Refactoring

Changing software in such a way that does not affect functionality of the program, but improves structure and maintainability of the software.

## Refactoring Today

- Pretty much all IDEs have refactoring tools built in
- Empirical studies show that practitioners still like to refactor manually (tools are hard to learn)
-  Current refactoring tools cannot absolutely guarantee semantic preservation. Therefore, refactoring goes hand in hand with unit testing.

## Two phase development cycles

- Iterative development

```
Expansion -------> Refactor
    ^                 |
    |_________________|
```
In expansion phase, don't worry about prettiness, you will refactor in the refactor phase.
