# Software Metrics
- Internal maintainability
  - depends on characteristics of SW system
- External maintainability
  - depends on surrounding infrastructure
- Objective metrics
  - can be quantified and measured
- Subjective metrics
  - Based on opinions

## What examples of internal maintainablility metrics do you know?

ex. Cyclomatic Complexity
- Software metric used to indicate complexity of a program.
- Measures this based on number of linearly independent paths through the program's source code.
- One testing strategy is to test each independent path through the program. So the number of test cases will equal the cyclomatic complexity of the program.

- When methods have 1 - 10, they are easy to understand and test
- 10 - 20 is more complex  but still comprehensible, testing is more difficult as there are more branches your program can take.
- 20 - 50 is very difficult to understand/test.
- and > 50 is certainly unmaintainable

## Metrics may depend on language/paradigm
(the way you measure the maintainability may be different depending on how you programmed the software)

- OO metrics
  - Measure on class level
    - coupling
    - Inheritance
    - Cohesion
    - Size
    - Structural complexity

### Measures of coupling
- Fan-out/Coupling between objects
  - Low CBO is desired, we want classes to be independent from eachother
  - number of times a method of class c calls a method or references a field of class d
- Response for Class
  - Measure of potential inter-class communication
  - number of methods of c + number of methods of other classes invoked by c.
- Message Passing Coupling
  - number of send statements in a defined classes

(These seem all the same)

### Measuring Inheritance
- Depth of inheritance tree
  - High depth = more faults
- Number of overridden methods
- Specialization index
- Number of children
  - Only immediate subclasses are counted
- Number of descendants
  - All subclasses are counted
- Reuse Ratio
  - U = #superclasses/total #classes
  - close to 1: linear hierarchy -> poor design
  - Close to 0: shallow depth
- Specialization Ratio
  - S = #subclasses/#superclasses
  - near 1: poor design
  - high value: good capture of abstractions in superclasses

### Cohesion Metrics
- Lack of cohesion of methods(LCOM)
- This finds how cohesive your methods are in terms of member variables. Do methods access the same variables? or do they function and use member variables separately?

![Image of dev activity](/Images/screenshot3.png)*NOMAF = number of methods that access a field*

LCOM:
  - Value of 0: perfect cohesion
  - Value of 1: complete lack of cohesion
  - Value >1: A field in C that is never used by a method of C.

### Strucural OO Metrics
- Weighted Methods per Class
- Good predictor of how much time/effort is required implement/maintain a class
- Sum of cyclomatic complexity of all methods and constructors of a class.
- Lower WMC = greater polymorphism
- High WMC = complex class, harder to reuse and maintain.
- Lower limit = 1, upper limit = 50 (like cyclomatic complexity)

### Halstead complexity Measures
> A computer program is an implementation of an algorithm considered to be a collection of tokens which can be classified as either operator or operands.

> -Halstead

- n1 = unique operators
- n2 = unique operands
- N1 = number of operators total
- N2 = Number of operands total

examples of operators:
- main
- ()
- {}
- int
- printf
- \*,/,=,+,&,%

examples of operands:
- a, b, c, avg
- "%d %d %d"

As we can see there are many tools for measuring internal metrics.

## External Metrics

### Complexity of tools matter
Study of accuracy rates of novices using Quorum, Perl, Rondomo Programming Languages
- Results showed that quorum users were afforded significantly greater accuracy compared to the other 2. Perl users were unable to write programs more accurately than those using a language designed by chance.

### Bug prediction
- Pareto Law
  - 80% of consequences flow from 20% of causes

So how do we locate the 20% of code that causes so many problems?

- using a variety of software metrics
- see where overlap in errors occur and we can figure out the main cause.

## Summary
- There are a large number of software metrics for measuring maintainability
- Concrete metrics depend on choice of technology and programming paradigm.
- Internal metrics differ from external metrics
- There is increasing empirical evidence about metrics usefulness
- When integrated in quality management systems, metrics can help keep software quality high, cohesive and maintainable.
